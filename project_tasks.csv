Epic,EpicLabel,Task,Description,Acceptance Criteria
Infrastructure Setup & DevOps Pipeline,infra-devops,Provision Kubernetes Cluster,"Provision a managed Kubernetes cluster (AWS EKS, Google GKE, or local kind/minikube for development).","- Kubernetes cluster is accessible via kubectl.
- Cluster nodes are healthy and ready.
- Documentation of cluster setup is added to repo."
Infrastructure Setup & DevOps Pipeline,infra-devops,Deploy Prometheus and Grafana,"Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization of cluster health and microservices.","- Prometheus is deployed and can scrape metrics.
- Grafana is deployed and login works.
- Basic dashboard shows CPU/Memory usage."
Infrastructure Setup & DevOps Pipeline,infra-devops,Set up CI/CD pipeline,"Create GitHub Actions workflow to automatically test, build, and deploy microservices to Kubernetes.","- Workflow triggers on push/PR.
- Services are built and deployed.
- Logs visible in GitHub Actions."
Data Streaming & Real-Time Services,data-streaming,Set up Kafka Cluster,"Deploy Kafka cluster to handle streaming of raw data from ultrasound devices.","- Kafka brokers are running.
- Topics created.
- Test producer/consumer works."
Data Streaming & Real-Time Services,data-streaming,Build Python Microservice for Kafka Consumer & Validation,"Build a Python microservice that consumes raw data from Kafka, validates it, and flags invalid records.","- Consumes Kafka messages.
- Validation rules applied.
- Invalid records logged."
Data Streaming & Real-Time Services,data-streaming,Implement Real-Time Data Producer Service,"Create a real-time service that streams clean data and produces each row as a Kafka message.","- Service containerized.
- Messages published to Kafka.
- Logging enabled."
Data Validation & Reconciliation,data-validation,Flink Job for Validation & Reconciliation,"Create a Flink-based job to validate streaming data in real-time and reconcile it.","- Flink job consumes Kafka.
- Invalid records flagged.
- Reconciliation logic applied."
