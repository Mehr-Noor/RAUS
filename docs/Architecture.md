## UI Mockups & Medical Review

Final UI mockups were prepared in Figma for both desktop and mobile views.

The mockups were reviewed by 3 medical professionals (radiologists and sonographers).
Key feedback included:
- Improving report text readability
- Reordering clinical findings
- Simplifying action buttons

The feedback was incorporated into the final design iteration.
The updated mockups were approved for MVP implementation.
